          <p>This experiment was created for the course Student conference in Computing Science at Ume√• University by Isidor Nygren, who is currently studying Interaction &amp; Design master program in the same university.</p>
          <p>The objective of the test is to see if there is a functional link between frequency and amplitude modulation in conjunction with 2D positioned objects on a plane. And as a part of this test, you will press a series of buttons with a variable sound playing in the background whilst your timing and method will be recorded and stored.</p>
